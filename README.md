# Date Parser
This package provides functionality to extract date information from sentences. 

Functionality is limited to only providing the date itself. Future updates will implement returning the sentence with the date parsed. 

The following sentences will be parsed successfully by the function:
* "Buy Groceries on Monday"
* "Buy Groceries next Sunday"
* "Buy Groceries today."
